Project Title: LED Brightness and Servomotor Angle Control System with Potentiometer and I2C LCD Display

Description:

In this project, I developed a system for controlling the brightness of an LED and the rotation angle of a servomotor using a potentiometer connected to an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). The system also integrates an LCD display using the I2C communication protocol to visualize the numerical value of the potentiometer in real-time.

The operation of the system is as follows:

Potentiometer Value Acquisition: A potentiometer is used to manually adjust the brightness level of the LED and the rotation angle of the servomotor. The analog value from the potentiometer is converted into a numerical value using the built-in ADC.

PWM Generation for LED: The numerical value obtained from the potentiometer is used to adjust the duty cycle of a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal generated by a timer. This PWM signal is then applied to the LED, allowing for the regulation of its brightness proportionally to the potentiometer value.

Servomotor Angle Control: The numerical value from the potentiometer is also utilized to determine the rotation angle of the servomotor. By adjusting this value, the user can precisely control the angular position of the servomotor.

I2C LCD Display: The numerical value from the potentiometer is displayed in real-time on an LCD display using the I2C communication protocol. This enables the user to easily visualize the current position of the potentiometer, facilitating precise adjustment of the LED brightness and servomotor angle.
